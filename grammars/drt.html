<H2>Discourse Representation Theory</H2>

<P>
This grammar is an implementation of <A href="#muskens1994">Reinhard
 Musken's ideas</A>
 for adding discourse representation theory (DRT) as a semantics for the
 Lambek calculus. It uses the simple associative Lambek calculus, but
 in the interest of keeping the resulting representations a bit more
 compact there is a strategic use of some non-associative implications
 not found in the original paper.

<P>
Grail permits the use of discourse representation structures (DRSs) in
its semantics using the following syntax.

<P>
<TT>
drs(ListOfVariables, ListOfConditions)
</TT>

<P>
So a DRS like the following

<P>
<TABLE border="1" cellspacing="0">
 <TR>
  <TD>
  x
  </TD>
 </TR>
 <TR>
  <TD>
  man(x) <BR>
  enter(x)<BR>
  smile(x)
  </TD>
 </TR>
</TABLE>

<P>will be represented as

<P>
<TT>
drs([X], [man(X),enter(X),smile(X)])
</TT>

<P>whereas a slightly more complicated DRS with embedded DRSs and an
  implication in the conditions


<P>
 will be represented as.

<H3>Remarks</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Note that there is currently no mechanism included to compute
 the different possible bindings of the personal pronouns.

<LI>Note as well that the grammar proposes multiple equivalent
  readings for many sentences, since all <I>np</I>'s in the grammar
  are lifted.
