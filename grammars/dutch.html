<H2>Dutch Word Order</H2>

<P>
This grammar implements one of Michael Moortgat's multimodal solution
deriving the different word orders for Dutch phrases: verb-initial for
question, verb-second for main clauses and verb-final for subordinate
clauses.

<P>
This grammar illustrates the usefulness of the shared forest
representation for graphs: all three phrase orders can be seen in the
graph and the box selects the correct one.
