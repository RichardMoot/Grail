<H2>Generalized Quantifiers</H2>

<P>
This grammar implements one of Michael Moortgat's solutions to
implementing the <B>q(A,B,C)</B> generalized quantifier in multimodal
categorial grammars. (C &#47;<SUB>1</SUB> (A &#92;<SUB>2</SUB> B))
&bull;<SUB>1</SUB> (A &#92;<SUB>2</SUB> A)

<P>
The example sentences illustrate the ambiguities which
arise when <I>wh</I> extraction and generalized quantifiers interact.
<P>
The source file uses custom first order labeling to restrict the axiom
links and in many cases, such as the example phrase <I>Fred thinks
every schoolboy believes a mathematician wrote Through the Looking
Glass</I>, only the correct axiom links are generated.
