Grail is a modern, flexible and robust parser/automated theorem prover for
multimodal categorial grammars. It is designed to allow students and
researchers to design and experiment with their grammars while at the
same time offer the advanced users many optional optimisation strategies.
<P>

Grail can be run either as a command line script or as an application
with a graphical interface, with the possibility to follow Grail's partial
parses/proof attemps interactively.

<H3>R<SMALL>EQUIREMENTS</SMALL></H3>

You will need to have <A HREF="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">SWI
Prolog</A> together with <A
HREF="http://www.swi-prolog.org/packages/xpce/">SWI Prolog's XPCE user
interface</A>
installed on your computer to run Grail.

<P>
In addition you need the <A
HREF="http://www.graphviz.org">GraphViz</A> set
of graph display tools to view the graphs produced by Grail.

<P>

The current distribution contains the 23 July 2015 (21:40:23 CEST) release of Grail 3.2.0; it has been verified to work with SWI-Prolog version 6.6.6 for x86_64-darwin13.1.0,
though everything should work properly on not-too-ancient SWI Prolog installations and for installations on other architectures as well.

<H3>I<SMALL>NSTALLATION</SMALL></H3>

Move the Grail tarball into the directory where you want to install it
and type.

<P>
<CODE>
tar xfz grail3.tgz
</CODE>

<P>

to extract all the necessary files from the archive.

The preferred method of installation is by simply typing.

<P>
<CODE>
./configure --prefix=/some/directory/
</CODE>

<P>
where <CODE>/some/directory/</CODE> is an existing directory where you
have write and execute permissions. Grail will be installed in the
subdirectory <CODE>Grail</CODE> of this directory, whereas the executable will end up in the <CODE>bin</CODE> subdirectory. The prefix defaults
to <CODE>/usr/local/</CODE>.

<P>
Continue by typing.

<P>
<CODE>
make
</CODE>

<P>
to compile the Grail files.

Finally, type.

<P>
<CODE>
make install
</CODE>

<P>
to install all Grail files. Now you can start Grail by typing.

<P>
<CODE>g3</CODE>

<P>or by

<P>
<CODE>/some/directory/bin/g3</CODE>

<P>
if your shell doesn't normally look at your installation path.
Remember also that Grail will try to
write its postscript files in the current working directory, so be
sure to run Grail from a place where you have writing permission if
you want to see the postscript output.

<H3>D<SMALL>OCUMENTATION</SMALL></H3>

A short introduction to using Grail 3 can be found in the
<A HREF="help.html">manual</A> or by selecting [Help/About Grail 3...]
from Grail's menu bar.

<P>
A more comprehensive <A href="http://www.labri.fr/perso/moot/tutorial">tutorial</A> is currently under construction.

<P>
Grail 3 is a new implementation of the Grail engine, using many of the
ideas first discussed in my <A HREF="http://www.library.uu.nl/digiarchief/dip/diss/1980438/inhoud.htm">thesis</A>. Notable improvements are:

<UL>
<LI> the way structural rules are applied in parallel
<LI>  the different methods to filter out axiom connections which can never contribute to a proof net
<LI> the default choice to connect the most restricted axiomatic formula first.
</UL>


<P>
An advantage of the way the subderivations are shared in the current
implementation is that Grail 3 functions as Grail 2 with the
<A href="all_solutions.txt">all_solutions.pl</A> extension enabled, without incurring a performance
penalty because of this.

<P>
The LaTeX natural deduction output of Grail 2 is currently not
supported by Grail 3.

The files <B>logarr.pl</B> (for logarithmic access arrays) <B>ordset.pl</B> (for
ordered sets) and the warshall/2 predicate from <B>graph.pl</B> are modified versions of the libraries by the same name in the Public
Domain DEC-10 Prolog Library. I am indebted to the authors of those
packages for putting their work in the public domain. Any blame for changes and
additions to their code is mine. See the individual files for changes.

<P>
The <B>tree234.pl</B> library for 2-3-4 trees is a direct adaptation of code belonging
to the <A HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/research/mercury/">Mercury
library</A>, a great resource for logic/functional programs of several
standard algorithms, which is available under <A

released under <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</A>). 
I am responsible for idiosyncratic additions to this code, as well as
modification of the code to use first argument indexing as much as
possible, in addition to any errors this may have produced.
